 rapprochement_with_the_donyorde_aspect: "Rapprochement with the Donyorde"
 desc_rapprochement_with_the_donyorde_aspect: "The Diuredonyorde are a branch of the Roog religion that followed the Norse-Andalusian armies to Iberia, and later moved to Sicily. Having lived among heathens for centuries, their customs and rituals are strange to us. Nevertheless we will harmonize with the house of peace and through them show a kinder face to the heathen."
 diurduany_mysticism_aspect: "Diurduany Mysticism"
 desc_diurduany_mysticism_aspect: "Mysticism has long been a part of our religion, but the Duany Enen have reached a point where they can almost be considered heretical. Their customs include reading the stars to determine the ancestry of a soul and the auspices of reincarnation. If we familiarize ourselves with their teachings and let them into our temples we will be better able to determine kinship decreed by Roog."
 intolerance_and_the_end_of_days_aspect: "Intolerance and the End of Days"
 desc_intolerance_and_the_end_of_days_aspect: "One sect usually shunned is the Battaadedubbi, a millenarian movement that stuck around. They are feverently xenophobic and urge war against heathen and heretic alike. While we would never let anyone associated with the Battaadedubbi into our administration, we could use their rhetoric and dogma to further our expansion into heathen lands."
 embracing_the_dondu_aspect: "Embracing the Dondu"
 desc_embracing_the_dondu_aspect: "We call the heathens and heretics Dondu, Jackals. But even jackals serve a purpose, and we might find it in our hearts to let them tend to their crosses and bow to their towers in the interest of keeping the peace. The clergy will be furious of course, but our administration and heathen subjects will appreciate it."
 shibboleth_of_change_aspect: "Shibboleth of Change"
 desc_shibboleth_of_change_aspect: "Our liturgical language is Pulaar, as is the language of our administration. With our consonants changing in ways unfamiliar to our neighbours, we can use simple pluralizations and phrases to distinguish between true believers and spies."
